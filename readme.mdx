# MDX processing of a VimWiki in Markdown

Tags: :mdx: :neovim: :snippets: :journaling: :blogging:

For privacy and easier syncing, Figure out how the multiple wiki thing works:

1. laptop
2. phone (will be accessing a specific directory on the server, but an app is
   not out of the question)
3. server


### Syncroznizing the laptop journals to the cloud where they can be edited on my ;phone

## Todo

- [ ] Turn rsync and git commands into scripts contolled from this laptop that
      accept either up or down as the single argument
      command into script that prepares to sync with server by committing
      changes 3 minutes after last change comes in in a batch (probably when
      I've closed out nvim and saved some files on the way, otherwise they're
      probably changes made during the course of work, in which case there
      should be a maximum amount of time that the 3 minutes has been
      interrupted continually for 30 minutes, so we will attempt to sync
      anyway.
- [ ] periodically run git backups branches named
      `periodic-(hostname)-(YYYY-MM-DD)`
- [ ] No two systems should be writing at the same time since there is only one
      one user who will be triggering the rsyncs through inotify by saving
      files, but implement a
      lockfile system where the system that wishes to push writes and syncs a
      lock, then waits ~10 seconds to init transfer


## I wish LsyncD worked on macOS, but it seems risky to use once, let alone
continually through the work day and all night

- [X] Get a command that syncs everything but the git folder using `lsyncd`
        [manual](https://axkibe.github.io/lsyncd/)
        [source code](https://github.com/axkibe/lsyncd)

      > `lsyncd` is apparently not compatible with macOS because it cannot access
      > fsevents for several years now and is imcompatible with time machine :(
      > https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42451353/having-trouble-with-rsync-version-on-mac-when-using-it-with-lsyncd
      >
      >     lsyncd -exclude ".git" -rsyncssh ~/cronofile o.lo ~/cronofile-scp
      >     lsyncd -log Exec -nodaemon lsyncd_to_olo.conf

- [ ] Create `sync` users on each system with `rw` access to `/var/cronofile`
- [ ] Give myself access to `/var/cronofile`
- [ ] make that command run all the time via `systemd`

## The pure rsync sync system

Had downsides including that there there would probably have to be separate
scripts for downloading and upload from the server, while the git model using a
single git repository as a centralized service provides easier use: "I am
leaving this computer so it's time to sync, or I am opening this computer so
it's time for me to sync.

      # The rsync Up Commands

      rsync -vaz -e ssh \
            --progress --partial --update \
            --exclude=".git" --exclude="diff.mx" \
            --exclude-from="$HOME/.gitignore" \
            --exclude-from="$HOME/cronofiles/.gitignore" \
            ~/cronofiles/ o.lo:~/cronofiles/

      rsync -vaz -e ssh \
            --progress --partial --update \
            --exclude=".git" --exclude="node_modules" \
            --exclude-from="$HOME/.gitignore" \
            --exclude-from="$HOME/cronofiles/.gitignore" \
            ~/Desktop/cronofiler/ o.lo:~/Desktop/cronofiler/

      # The rsync Down Command
